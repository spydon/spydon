### Hi there, I'm Lukas Klingsbo (or simply spydon) 👋
💖 I love keyboards (Dactyl Manuform), code, climbing and backpacking.

![Flame icon](https://github.com/flame-engine/brand/blob/main/icons/favicon.png) I quit my job to work for free on Flame, which is a game engine for Flutter.

💸 If you like the work that I do, you can consider sponsoring me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/spydon/), or just hit the `Follow` button.

⌨️ If you use Flame, you will probably see me around:
 - in the pull request and issues section of [Flame](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame)
 - answering questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/789545/spydon) 
 - and on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pxrBmy4)
 - Oh yes, and also on Flutter and GameDev conferences.

🤖 Fun fact: I'm currently rated as the [28th most active GitHub user](https://commits.top/sweden.html) in Sweden.
